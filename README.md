Industrial Data Breach Monitoring System (Dataset-Based)

Project Overview

Industries manage sensitive data across multiple digital systems such as emails, databases, IoT devices, and networks. Cyberattacks on these systems are increasing, but understanding past breach incidents and their impact remains challenging. This project presents a dataset-based Industrial Data Breach Monitoring System that analyzes historical breach data to identify security threats, affected data sources, and resolution status using visual dashboards and analytics.

Problem Statement

Existing cybersecurity tools often fail to clearly explain which industrial data was breached, how severe the impact was, and whether the issue was resolved. Security information is scattered across systems, making breach analysis complex and highly dependent on security experts. There is a need for a simple system to analyze historical breach data and provide clear insights.

Key Issues

- Security breach information spread across multiple systems
- Difficulty in identifying affected data sources
- Lack of clear explanation of breach impact
- Poor visibility of breach resolution status
- High dependency on cybersecurity experts

Proposed Solution

This project introduces a dataset-based Industrial Data Breach Monitoring Dashboard that analyzes pre-existing breach datasets. The system studies past incidents, displays breach details visually, tracks resolution status, and provides automated security recommendations to help understand and mitigate cybersecurity risks. This project does not perform real-time monitoring and is designed for analysis and learning purposes.

Key Features

- Analysis of historical industrial data breach datasets
- Breach classification by type, source, and status
- Display of breach details such as IP address, timestamp, and affected system
- Incident tracking with “Resolved” and “Unresolved” status
- Email breach verification using dataset records
- Visual analytics comparing total vs resolved breaches
- Automated security recommendations (credential reset, IP blocking, 2FA suggestions)
- Interactive dashboard with color-based alert indicators

Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

Dataset Description

The project uses an existing dataset containing information about industrial and IoT-related data breaches, including breach type, affected systems, timestamps, IP addresses, and resolution status.

How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install required Python libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook
4. View breach analysis results and visual dashboards

Applications

- Cybersecurity education and training
- Academic mini-projects
- Cyber event and prototype demonstrations
- Understanding industrial data breach patterns

Conclusion

This dataset-based Industrial Data Breach Monitoring System helps analyze historical cybersecurity incidents and provides clear insights into breach patterns and resolution status. The project serves as an effective learning and analytical tool for understanding cybersecurity challenges in industrial environments.
